We treat your personal data as confidential and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.\n\nPersonal data is any data with which you could be personally identified.\n\nPlease note that data transmitted via the internet (e.g. via email communication) may be subject to security breaches. Complete protection of your data from third-party access is not possible.\n\n### SSL encryption\n\nThis site uses SSL encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the transmission of confidential content, such as the inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it changes from \"http://\" to \"https://\" and the lock icon is displayed in your browser's address bar.\nIf SSL encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.\n\n## Data collection\n\n### Server log files\n\nThe website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in \"server log files\".\n\nThese are:\n\n- Browser type and browser version\n- Operating system used\n- Referrer URL\n- Host name of the accessing computer\n- Time of the server request\n- IP address\n\nThese data will not be combined with data from other sources.\n\nThe basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.\n\n### Newsletter\n\nWe offer to subscribe to updates and information through our newsletter. We will only send you these updates and information through our newsletter with your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO) or based onlegal permission. In case that the content of the newsletter is described further with the signup form, this description is the basis of the consent given when signing up through that form.\n\nThe subscription to our newsletter is handled through double opt-in. That means that you will get a confirmation email, that will ask you to actively confirm your subscription. This procedure is necessary so that no one can subscribe with an email address that doesn’t belong to them.\n\nThe signups are being logged to be able to prove that the subscription process followed legal requirements. For that purpose, the IP address, as well as the date and time of the registration, are being stored. On top of that, the changes you make to your data that are stored with the newsletter provider are also being logged.\n\nWe can store the registered email addresses after unsubscribing for up to three years before deletingthem on the grounds of our legitimate interest to be able to prove consent given at an earlier time. The processing of these data is limited to the purpose of defense against claims. It is always possible to file an individual request for deletion if the former consent is being confirmed while doing so.\n\nLegal grounds: We send out our newsletter based on the grounds of consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO) given by the subscriber. The logging of the subscription happens on the grounds of our legitimate interest to be able to prove that the subscription process followed legal requirements. The commissioning of a newsletter provider is based on the grounds of our legitimate interest in an efficient and safe newsletter system.\n\nThe content of our newsletter is information, updates, and news about us.\n\nThe newsletters contain a so-called “web-beacon”, which is a tracking pixel, a miniature graphic embedded in the email. Through this tracking pixel, several data can be collected: Technical information like information about the browser and system as well as your IP-address. It also tracks if, when, and where the newsletter was opened and which links were clicked. This information is being linked to your subscriber profile and is stored until their deletion. Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters and our services to the interests of the target audience. The tracking and storage of the information collected through the tracking pixels are based on the grounds of the consent given by the subscriber. It is not possible to only revoke your consent to the tracking. In this case, you need to opt-out of receiving the newsletter entirely so that the stored profile information will be deleted.\n\nYou can opt-out of receiving our newsletter at any time and thereby revoke your consent to receive further newsletters. For that purpose, you can use the unsubscribe link we provide you with at the end of every newsletter.\n\nAs a newsletter provider, we use the marketing platform „Mailchimp“ – Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE #5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA ([https://mailchimp.com](https://mailchimp.com)). You can find their privacy policy [here](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/). If you provide data (e.g. your email address) to subscribe to our newsletter, it will be stored on Mailchimp servers in the USA. MailChimp is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.\n\n### Analytics\n\nTo best protect your privacy we set up our analytics tools to only store anonymized data. The tools we use are:\n\n- [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) to evaluate the website performance (like loading times)\n- [Splitbee Analytics](https://splitbee.io) to track page visits (e.g.: How many visitors were there? What devices were used? Were did the visitors come from? Which pages did they visit?) Wie viele Besucher:innen? Mit welchen Geräten? Woher kommen die Besucher:innen? Welche Seiten haben sie besucht?). If you want to see what data is visualized there you can have a look at our public analytics dashboard.\n\n## Rights of the individual\n\n### Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data\n\nMany data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.\n\n### Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities\n\nIf there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities. The competent regulatory authority for matters related to data protection legislation is the data protection officer of the German state in which our company is headquartered. A list of data protection officers and their contact details can be found at the following [link](https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html).\n\n### Right to data portability\n\nYou have the right to have data which we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you require the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.\n\n### Information, blocking, deletion\n\nAs permitted by law, you have the right to be provided at any time with information free of charge about any of your personal data that is stored as well as its origin, the recipient and the purpose for which it has been processed. You also have the right to have this data corrected, blocked or deleted. You can contact us at any time using the address given in our legal notice if you have further questions on the topic of personal data.\n",

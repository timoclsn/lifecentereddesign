                    <strong>User-centered design</strong> (UCD) is an approach
                    for designing interactive systems that places the users and
                    their needs in the center of the design process. It has been
                    around for ages now, first gaining popularity in 1986
                    through the book „User-Centered System Design: New
                    Perspectives on Human-Computer Interaction“ by Donald A.
                    Norman and Stephen W. Draper.

                <p>
                    The DIN EN ISO 9241-210, where this approach is defined, is
                    now using the term human-centered design (HCD) to
                    acknowledge, that there are several more stakeholders who
                    are affected by a product or service than just their users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With that very same attitude, several questions can be
                    posed: Is it enough to focus the design around human
                    stakeholders? Are we the only ones affected by our products?
                    What about long-term effects – are we considering them as
                    well? Or effects that are more indirect and might be hidden
                    under the surface of short-term user needs?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to human-centered design, no ISO standard
                    defines life-centered design as a term and practice. The
                    notion of “life-centered design” is still in the formation
                    and I don’t feel like that there are a common understanding
                    and consense for what it means (yet) or if that is the term
                    to be used for what we want to express. On top of that,
                    there aren’t a lot of best practices for a life-centered
                    approach. Nevertheless, the questions posed above seek to be
                    answered. And life-centered design is (at least for me) a
                    term that fits well enough to drive the conversation around
                    these questions further.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is why I want to create Life Centered Design.Net. It is
                    supposed to be a home for information, resources, and
                    conversations to evolve beyond human-centered and user
                    experience design.

                        This is Katharina. My husband Timo and I are the two
                        people behind Life Centered Design.Net.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have developed a passion for the mindset I associate
                        with life-centered design. I am trying to weave in parts
                        of this mindset into the things I do as Head of Strategy
                        & UX at Codeatelier, a lecturer at Stuttgart Media
                        University and University of Applied Sciences Esslingen,
                        and as a board member of the Makers League e. V.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My husband Timo, CEO at Codeatelier shares this passion
                        â€“ especially when it comes to sustainability in (web)
                        technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because of my deep interest in that topic but also due
                        to the fact, that it was very hard for me to find
                        information and best practices on life-centered design
                        in the past years, I wanted to create Life Centered
                        Design.Net
